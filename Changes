Revision history for Perl extension Apache::GD::Graph.

0.94	Thu Apr  3 21:06:14 PST 2003
	- Added compatibility with mod_perl for Apache2.
	- Made test skip in Apache2 (too lazy to fix it right now).

0.93	Sat Nov 17 14:59:03 PST 2001
	- Added relative path support for files/fonts etc. So that things like
	  ../fonts/arial.ttf will resolve relative to DocumentRoot. Or
	  to_file=../images/foo.png, etc.. Thanks to Joseph Pepin for the
	  suggestion.
	- Boxed captions in plain/dashed/dotted/whatever style.
	- Support builtin GD fonts Like gdSmallFont.
	- Cleaner code and misc. minor bugs fixed.

0.92	Tue Apr 24 11:36:19 PDT 2001
	- Previous versions couldn't handle more than 9 arguments because of a
	  silly string increment bug :) Thanks to Drew Degentesh for pointing
	  this out.

0.91	Tue Feb  6 16:37:56 PST 2001
	- Added a background_image option to make it simpler to add background
	  images to graphs.
	- Added no_axes parameter.
	- Added PerlSetVar TTFFontPath to set the path to search for True Type
	  fonts in GD::Text, and consequently any font related methods in
	  GD::Graph.
	- Fixed another minor caching snafu (PerlSetVar CacheSize 0 still
	  checked for cached images).
	- Expanded pod docs a bit.
	- Fixed exceptions, for the last time I hope.
	- Added support for captions at arbitrary locations in the graph, with
	  any font.

0.9	Tue Oct 17 11:38:53 PDT 2000
	- Added a list type () for set_XXX methods. Eg. legend=(mon,tue,wed)
	  will now work.
	- Now support x-www-form-urlencoded data sent via a POST request.
	- Added a to_file parameter, if set the generated graph will be saved
	  to the destination file on the server.

0.8	Mon Oct  9 22:44:05 PDT 2000
	- Since 0.7, the default for the X axis is to NOT have any labels.
	- The "expires" parameter didn't really work, fixed.
	- The parameter cache=0 in the query string still hit the cache if the
	  image was already there, fixed.
	- Was checking for "Accepts" header, when needed to check for "Accept"
	  header.
	- Now checking for set_XXX methods as options, so methods like
	  set_legend(), set_font(), etc will work.

0.7	Wed Sep 14 18:47:27 PDT 2000
	- Added support for image types other than png via PerlSetVar
	  ImageType, and the image_type parameter, and via Accepts header
	  (Thanks to Scott Holdren for the idea and patch.)
	- Better parsing. Empty values in arrays (like [,foo,bar,,]) will work,
	  as well as quoted strings. (Thanks to Scott Holdren for the former.)
	- New argument "expires" allows configuration of Expires header on a
	  request basis.
	- New argument "cache" allows requests to not use the server-side
	  cache.
	- Improved error handling again.
	- Now know how to make graphs without axes, see man page.

0.6	Mon Sep  4 15:16:01 PDT 2000
	- Got rid of all cache handling code and now using File::Cache, as I
	  should have done in the first place.
	- PerlSetVar CacheDir is gone (File::Cache uses its own).
	- PerlSetVar CacheSize added (size in bytes).

0.5	Sat Sep  2 21:48:18 PDT 2000
	- Fixes from Vivek Khera
		- Didn't create directory correctly on BSD.
		- Use File::Path::mkpath to create directory and untaints graph
		  type so that module is taint safe.
		- Foreach loop syntax didn't work with 5.004.
	- Fixed error handling again, now one eval block wrapping handler.
	- Added PerlSetVar CacheDir and PerlSetVar Expires to control the
	  server side cache directory and value of the Expires header in days,
	  respectively.
	- Deletes retrieved files after itself.
	- Beginnings of a better test suite.
	- Just run pod2text on the module to create README, as opposed to not
	  having a README I guess.


0.4	Thu Aug 17 15:57:30 PDT 2000
	- Changed list of values syntax from 1,2,3... to [1,2,3]. Supports
	  arrays for all GD::Graph options as well as hashes, urls and undef,
	  see man page.
	- Added better error handling.
	- Caches under /var/cache/Apache::GD::Graph instead of /tmp/graph-<pid>
	  which was kinda silly.

0.3	Thu Aug  3 15:30:03 PDT 2000
	- Plots y values for any number of arrays (I misunderstood the
	  GD::Graph manpage). Fixed syntax and documentation to reflect this.

0.2	Wed Aug  2	    2000
	- Fixed ABSTRACT in Makefile.PL and MANIFEST.

0.1	Tue Aug  1 15:40:42 2000
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.20 with options
		-A -X -n Apache::GD::Graph
