Revision history for Perl extension Apache::GD::Graph.

0.1	Tue Aug  1 15:40:42 2000
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.20 with options
		-A -X -n Apache::GD::Graph

0.2	Wed Aug  2	    2000
	- Fixed ABSTRACT in Makefile.PL and MANIFEST.

0.3	Thu Aug  3 15:30:03 PDT 2000
	- Plots y values for any number of arrays (I misunderstood the
	  GD::Graph manpage). Fixed syntax and documentation to reflect this.

0.4	Thu Aug 17 15:57:30 PDT 2000
	- Changed list of values syntax from 1,2,3... to [1,2,3]. Supports
	  arrays for all GD::Graph options as well as hashes, urls and undef,
	  see man page.
	- Added better error handling.
	- Caches under /var/cache/Apache::GD::Graph instead of /tmp/graph-<pid>
	  which was kinda silly.

0.5	Sat Sep  2 21:48:18 PDT 2000
	- Fixes from Vivek Khera
		- Didn't create directory correctly on BSD.
		- Use File::Path::mkpath to create directory and untaints graph
		  type so that module is taint safe.
		- Foreach loop syntax didn't work with 5.004.
	- Fixed error handling again, now one eval block wrapping handler.
	- Added PerlSetVar CacheDir and PerlSetVar Expires to control the
	  server side cache directory and value of the Expires header in days,
	  respectively.
	- Deletes retrieved files after itself.
	- Beginnings of a better test suite.
	- Just run pod2text on the module to create README, as opposed to not
	  having a README I guess.
