Revision history for Perl extension Apache::GD::Graph.

0.01	Tue Aug  1 15:40:42 2000
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.20 with options
		-A -X -n Apache::GD::Graph

0.02	Wed Aug  2	    2000
	- Fixed ABSTRACT in Makefile.PL and MANIFEST.

0.03	Thu Aug  3 15:30:03 PDT 2000
	- Plots y values for any number of arrays (I misunderstood the
	  GD::Graph manpage). Fixed syntax and documentation to reflect this.

0.04	Thu Aug 17 15:57:30 PDT 2000
	- Changed list of values syntax from 1,2,3... to [1,2,3]. Supports
	  arrays for all GD::Graph options as well as hashes, urls and undef,
	  see man page.
	- Added better error handling.
	- Caches under /var/cache/Apache::GD::Graph instead of /tmp/grap-<pid>
	  which was kinda silly.
