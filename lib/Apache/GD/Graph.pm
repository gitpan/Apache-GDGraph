=head1 NAME

Apache::GD::Graph - Generate Graphs in an Apache handler.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In httpd.conf:

	#PerlModule Apache::compat # uncomment this in Apache2!

	<Location /chart>
	SetHandler	perl-script
	PerlHandler	+Apache::GD::Graph
	## These are optional (defaults shown)
	## 				In days:
	#PerlSetVar	Expires		30
	#
	##				In megs:
	#PerlSetVar	CacheSize	5242880
	#PerlSetVar	ImageType	png
	#PerlSetVar	JpegQuality	75 # 0 to 100
	#PerlSetVar	TTFFontPath	/usr/ttfonts:
	#/var/ttfonts:/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/ttf/:
	#/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/truetype/:
	#/usr/share/fonts/truetype
	</Location>

Then send requests to:

	http://www.server.com/chart?type=lines&
	x_labels=[1st,2nd,3rd,4th,5th]&
	data1=[1,2,3,4,5]&
	data2=[6,7,8,9,10]&
	dclrs=[blue,yellow,green]>

Options can also be sent as x-www-form-urlencoded data (ie., a form). This
allows simple charting forms to be set up, also, Internet Explorer does not
allow query strings larger than a kilobyte so in those cases a POSTED form must
be used.  Parameters in the query string take precedence over a form if
specified.

=head1 INSTALLATION

Like any other CPAN module, if you are not familiar with CPAN modules, see:
http://www.cpan.org/doc/manual/html/pod/perlmodinstall.html

MAKE SURE TO RESTART YOUR APACHE SERVER using C<apachectl graceful> after
upgrading this or any other Apache Perl module.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The primary purpose of this module is to allow a very easy to use, lightweight
and fast charting capability for static pages, dynamic pages and CGI scripts,
with the chart creation process abstracted and placed on any server.

For example, embedding a pie chart can be as simple as:

	<img src="http://www.some-server.com/chart?type=pie&
	x_labels=[greed,pride,wrath]&data1=[10,50,20]&
	dclrs=[green,purple,red]"
	alt="pie chart of a few deadly sins">
	<!-- All above options are optional except for data1 -->

And it gets cached both server side, and along any proxies to the client, and
on the client's browser cache. Not to mention, chart generation is
very fast.

Of course, more complex things will be better done directly in your own Perl
handlers, but this module allows a non-Perl environment to have access to the
capabilities of GD::Graph.

Another solution is to use ASP scripting with Microsoft Excel, which of course
requires a Windows NT server and I have no idea how easy this is to do, or how
fast.

There are also many other ways to connect programs with charting capabilities,
such as GNUPlot, or rrdtool to a web server. These may or may not be
faster/more featureful etc.

=head1 TIPS

Most more complicated things depend on knowing the GD::Graph interface.

Firstly, B<make sure you are not using any spaces!> If you want to pass a space in
a parameter in a URL-encoded string, use C<%20>, in a form use a C<+>.

Make sure to use C<cache=0> or C<PerlSetVar CacheSize 0> when debugging,
otherwise you will spend hours being very confused.

=head1 FONTS

GD::Graph has some options that take a font description, such as title_font,
legend_font, etc. (these map to the appropriate set_FOO methods in GD::Graph,
see that manpage).

The following fonts are built-in to GD, these strings will resolve into the
appropriate fonts except when quoted:

gdSmallFont, gdLargeFont, gdMediumBoldFont, gdTinyFont, gdGiantFont

There is also a way to use your own True Type Fonts. See the TTFFontPath
variable under SYNOPSIS for how to set the search path for fonts. MAKE SURE
your fonts are readable by the user the Apache server runs under, this is
usually "www-data" or "nobody". Otherwise your fonts will mysteriously fail
with no notice.

Fonts can also be specified as a relative path to the DocumentRoot of the
server, these must begin with "../". For example, if you have a directory
"fonts" under DocumentRoot, then you might specify a font like so:

	../fonts/arial.ttf

If DocumentRoot happens to be C</var/www> then the font that will be looked up
is C</var/www/fonts/arial.ttf>.

Sizes can be specified by using a list with the name and size. For example, if
arial.ttf can be found somewhere in your TTFFontPath, you can do:

	...title_font=(arial.ttf,20)

To get a title using font Arial, in 20 points.

Note that GD::Text does not parse out the names of fonts and such, you have to
give it an actual filename, matches are case-insensitive. So if using the
Microsoft Windows core fonts, Arial Bold would be C<arialbd.ttf>. Here's an
example:

	http://server/chart?data1=[1,2,3,4,5]&
	title_font=(arialbd.ttf,20)&
	title=Just%20A%20Line

=head1 COLORS

All colors, including those specified for the captionN option, are specified
using the colour names from L<GD::Graph::colour>. They are, at time of writing:

white, lgray, gray, dgray, black, lblue, blue, dblue, gold, lyellow, yellow,
dyellow, lgreen, green, dgreen, lred, red, dred, lpurple, purple, dpurple,
lorange, orange, pink, dpink, marine, cyan, lbrown, dbrown.

=head1 IMAGES

You can place a logo in any corner of the graph using the C<logo>,
C<logo_resize> and C<logo_position> options. See L<GD::Graph>. If you just want
a background image that is resized to fit your graph, see the
C<background_image> option herein.

=head1 TEXT/CAPTIONS

The following GD::Graph options control placing text on the graph: title,
x_label and y_label. L<GD::Graph> for those and related options. In addition,
this modules allows you to use the captionN option(s), to draw arbitrary
strings on the graph. See below.

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

This module is implemented as a simple Apache mod_perl handler that generates
and returns a png format graph (using Martien Verbruggen's GD::Graph module)
based on the arguments passed in via a query string. It responds with the
content-type "image/png" (or whatever is set via C<PerlSetVar ImageType>), and
sends a Expires: header of 30 days (or whatever is set via C<PerlSetVar
Expires>, or expires in the query string, in days) ahead.

In addition, it keeps a server-side cache in the file system using DeWitt
Clinton's File::Cache module, whose size can be specified via C<PerlSetVar
CacheSize> in bytes.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 8

=item B<type>

Type of graph to generate, can be lines, bars, points, linespoints, area,
mixed, pie. For a description of these, see L<GD::Graph(3)>. Can also be one of
the 3d types if GD::Graph3d is installed, or anything else with prefix
GD::Graph::.

=item B<width>

Width of graph in pixels, 400 by default.

=item B<height>

Height of graph in pixels, 300 by default.

=item B<expires>

Date of Expires header from now, in days. Same as C<PerlSetVar Expires>.

=item B<image_type>

Same as C<PerlSetVar ImageType>. "png" by default, but can be anything
supported by GD.

If not specified via this option or in the config file, the image type can also
be deduced from a single value in the 'Accept' header of the request.

=item B<jpeg_quality>

Same as C<PerlSetVar JpegQuality>. A number from 0 to 100 that determines the
jpeg quality and the size. If not set at all, the GD library will determine the
optimal setting. Changing this value doesn't seem to do much as far as line
graphs go, but YMMV.

=item B<background_image>

Set an image as the background for the graph. You are responsible for choosing
a sane image to go with your graph, the background should be either transparent
or the same color you will use. This is the same as using the C<logo> parameter
with an image of the same size as the graph, except this option will resize the
image if necessary, making it more convenient for this purpose. The file or URL
can be of any type your copy of GD supports.

=item B<captionN>

Draws a character string using a TrueType font at an arbitrary location.  Takes
an array of
C<($fgcolor,$fontname,$ptsize,$angle,$x,$y,$string[,$box_color,$box_offset])>
where $fgcolor is the foreground color, $fontname is the name of a TTF font see
L</FONTS> , $ptsize is the point size, $x and $y are the coordinates, and
$string is the actual characters to draw.

$box_color and $box_offset are optional parameters, if set the caption will be
drawn with a box around it in that color and that distance from the caption
string. The default offset of 9 should work well in most cases.

N is an integer from 1 onward, like for the dataN option. This lets you specify
multiple strings to draw.

B<Note:> you cannot use builtin GD fonts like gdTinyFont for captions, you have
to use a real TTF font.

This uses the GD stringTTF method, see L<GD>. Colour names are indexed using
the GD::Graph::colour builtins (see above), fonts are resolved by font path or
relative to DocumentRoot, parameters are processed as per L</DATA TYPES>.

Angle is in degrees, you will primarily use angle C<0> for normal left-to-right
text. $x and $y are pixel coordinates from the upper left corner. $fontname is
the name of a true-type font that will be found in the font path L</FONTS>.
Example:

	http://isis/chart?data1=[1,2,3,4,5]&
	caption1=(1,arial.ttf,9,0,30,30,Hello,red)

To draw the box around the caption as a dashed or dotted line use:

=item B<gd_set_style>

This option sets the style for the special gdStyled color index. It's simply a
list of colors that becomes the pattern for lines and such drawn with it. For
example, to get a dashed red line:

	gd_set_style=(red,red,red,red,red,red,
	gdTransparent,gdTransparent,
	gdTransparent,gdTransparent);

The list can be arbitrarily long.

B<Note:> at this time, the only place where you can use colors of this style is
for the box around a caption. Just specify C<gdStyled> as the color.

=item B<cache>

Boolean value which determines whether or not the image will get cached
server-side (for client-side caching, use the "expires" parameter). It is true
(1) by default. Setting C<PerlSetVar CacheSize 0> in the config file will
achieve the same affect as C<cache=0> in the query string.

=item B<to_file>

The graph will not be sent back, but instead saved to the file indicated on the
server. Apache will need permission to write to that directory. The result will
not be cached. This is basically the same as making an RPC call to a Perl
process to make a graph and store it to a file.

=item B<no_axes>

This sets x_labels to an empty lists and sets y_number_format to "",
effectively disabling axes labels.

=back

For the following, look at the plot method in L<GD::Graph(3)>.

=over 8

=item B<x_labels>

Labels used on the X axis, the first array given to the plot method of
GD::Graph. If unspecified or undef, no labels will be drawn.

=item B<dataN>

Values to plot, where N is a number starting with 1. Can be given any number of
times with N increasing.

=back

ALL OTHER OPTIONS are passed to the corresponding set_<option> method, or the
set(<option hash>) method using the following rules for the values:jj

=over 8

=head1 DATA TYPES

=item B<undef>

Becomes a real undef.

=item B<[one,two,3]>

Becomes an array reference.

=item B<(one,two,3)>

This becomes a list, you can pass lists to set_SOMETHING methods of GD::Graph,
if there is no corresponding set_ method, the list will be silently converted
to an anonymous array and used in an ordinary option.

=item B<{one,1,two,2}>

Becomes a hash reference.

=item B<http://somewhere/file.png>

Is pulled into a file and the file name is passed to the respective option.
(Can be any scheme besides http:// that LWP::Simple supports.)

=item B<../fonts/arial.ttf>

Paths following this pattern will be interpreted as paths relative to
DocumentRoot of the web server.

=item B<gdSmallFont, gdLargeFont, gdMediumBoldFont, gdTinyFont, gdGiantFont,
	gdStyled, gdBrushed, gdStyledBrushed, gdTransparent>

These are reserved strings. If not quoted, they will be converted to the
builtin GD constants of the same name. See L<GD> for details.

=item B<[undef,something,undef] or {key,undef}>

You can create an array or hash with undefs.

=item B<['foo',bar] or 'baz' or {'key','value'}>

Single and double quoted strings are supported, either as singleton values or
inside arrays and hashes.

DON'T USE SPACES, this is a common mistake. A space in a URL-encoded string is
%20, or a + in a form.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This module owes its existance, obviously, to the availability of the wonderful
GD::Graph module from Martien Verbruggen <mgjv@comdyn.com.au>.

Thanks to my employer, Gradience, Inc., for allowing me to work on projects
as free software.

Thanks to Vivek Khera, Scott Holdren and Drew Negentesh for the bug fixes.

=head1 BUGS

Probably a few.

We should probably just let people set up their own PerlFixupHandlers for
errors, but this makes it more difficult to set up. At least, it should be an
option.

=head1 TODO

Variable mapping of x-labels to data points.
Better test suite.
